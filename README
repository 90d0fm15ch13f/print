This is a very simple and unsecure script to print a file to the bb136 printer

	I have added a setup script that should take care of local setup
	To run ensure that you have the most recent version of expect
	Then extract the zip to your scripts directory and run setup.sh


Note that this script assumes you have shared your ssh keys with both imagine and the bbbox

	if you haven't refer to this website and be sure to set the authorized_keys file to 600

Usage
 	
	Call the script, it is recommened to add an alias in your .bashrc or other file.
	The first argument passed is the file to be printed and the second is the number to be printed out.

Dependencies
	-expect
