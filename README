this is a very simple and unsecure script to print a file to the bb136 printer
User TODO
	-in printhelp.sh add the path to scripts (or where you saved the print.sh file)
	-in print.sh add user names and passwords as required
	-chmod u+x
	-add alias print='<path/to/printhelp.sh>' to .bashrc (optional)

note that this script assumes you have shared your ssh keys with both imagine and the bbbox

if you haven't refer to this website and be sure to set the authorized_keys file to 600
